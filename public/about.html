<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>At the end of 2022 I decided to change my professional career by starting in another profession very different from the one I have.
  I have always been interested in computer science and how the technology that we use nowadays works, 
  so seeing the rapid development of computer science in the working world, I decided to jump into the pool and try to build a career in this field.</p>

<p>I am a curious person who likes to learn new things all the time and who has no problems when it comes to looking for information on my own. 
  I also consider that I am suitable for this profession because I like to solve complex problems, as well as working in a team. 
  Given my background as a psychologist I believe I am more than capable of managing the emotions involved in this job.</p>

<p>For now my training is reduced to a pretty intense and complete course of programming in general, 
  thanks to Avanza Centro de Formaci√≥n para el Empeo and a Full Stack Developer course from Udemy (in progress). 
  However, in September I will start the Higher Degree in Multiplatform Application Development. 
  Until then, I hope to get the opportunity to gain work experience while I continue training with online courses, 
  because I know that in this profession training never ends.</p>
